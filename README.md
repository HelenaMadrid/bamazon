# Project Title

Bamazon

## How does it works?

Bamazon is an Amazon-like store where you can buy products as a customer and view inventory of products and add new products and stock of those products as a Manager.
Although this assignment was a three part challenge, I only managed to do two and a half due to time.

## How can I use it?

When you run *node bamazonCustomer* all the products available at the story will print, from which the customer will choose one and input how many of it he wants. If the customer inputs a number greater that the existence of that product, there will be a message informing him that there is not enough stock and the transaction will terminate without changing the database, as if the purchase never came through.


When you run *node bamazonManager* the first thing that comes up is a menu that asks what do you want to do. The options are: 1. view all inventory, 2. view low inventory, 3. add stock to a product, 4. add new product, and 5. exit.
